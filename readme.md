#Vegas Tools - Community Extensions for Sony Vegas

[toc]

##Overview

An Open Source project to extend ***Sony Vegas Pro*** through it's plugin model. Developed initially to help create some custom video effects for internal and personal video projects. We thought it would be useful to other content producers out there and would like to see it improved by the community.

##Current Commands

### Create Video Wall

Creates a "wall" of video tracks using track motion. Does flyover zooming in and out between tracks. Usefull to show lots of individual clips with quick highlights.

###Order Events By Name and In Time

Orders the events in a track based on the name of the source media and then the starting offset of the current event based on the source media. Does not change the source track of an event, just the starting time. Grouped events all get the same start time (will change to keep relative time position in the future).

###Randomize Events

Randomizes selected events position in the timeline. Does not change the source track of an event.
