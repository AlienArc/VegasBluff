{"name":"Bluff","tagline":"Extension library for Sony Vegas Pro 12+","body":"An Open Source project to help make you look like you know what you are doing in ***Sony Vegas Pro***. Developed using **Vegas'** extension model, it takes you a step beyond what can easily be done inside a standard script. Developed initially to help create some custom video effects for internal and personal video projects. We thought it would be useful to other content producers out there and would like to see it improved by the community.\r\n\r\nRequires Sony Vegas Pro. Tested and built against Sony Vegas Pro 12, and should also work with version 13.\r\n\r\n##Getting it\r\n\r\nTo install the extension just download the current [release](https://github.com/AlienArc/VegasBluff/releases/latest \"latest release\") and follow the directions.\r\n\r\n##Current Commands\r\n\r\n###Track Motion\r\n\r\n####Create Video Wall\r\n\r\nCreates a \"wall\" of video tracks using track motion. Does flyover zooming in and out between tracks. Useful to show lots of individual clips with quick highlights.\r\n\r\n###Events\r\n\r\n####Order Events by Name and In Time\r\n\r\nOrders the events in a track based on the name of the source media and then the starting offset of the current event based on the source media. Does not change the source track of an event, just the starting time. Grouped events all get the same start time (will change to keep relative time position in the future).\r\n\r\n####Randomize Events\r\n\r\nRandomizes selected events position in the timeline. Does not change the source track of an event.\r\n\r\n###Region and Markers\r\n\r\n####Convert Markers to Regions\r\n\r\nIterates through markers and creates a region between every two markers.\r\n\r\n####Reorder Markers\r\n\r\nReorders the markers in the project to be sequential.\r\n\r\n####Split Region\r\n\r\nSplits the region under the timeline position into two regions at the current position.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nBluff is maintained by @AlienArc with major contributions from @DuaneNewman.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
